# 🎄 Advent of Code - Python Solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, written in Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day features a two-part programming puzzle that becomes progressively more challenging. It's a great way to improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun with code during the holiday season.

## Project Structure

```
advent-of-code/
├── 2025/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── day02/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   └── helpers.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Each day's folder contains:
- `solution.py` - The solution code for both parts
- `input.txt` - My personal puzzle input (this would be the sample not the full input)
- `README.md` - Problem description and notes


## Approach

I aim to write clean, readable Python code that:
- Solves both parts of each day's puzzle
- Uses appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Includes comments explaining the logic
- Balances clarity with performance

## Notes

- Input files are personal to each participant and should not be shared publicly per Advent of Code's creator's request
- Solutions are my own work, though I may reference algorithms or techniques when learning
- Some solutions are optimized for readability over performance
- I update this repo as I complete each day's challenges
